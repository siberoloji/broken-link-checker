This code can check broken links just on your site. No outer URL permitted.

🛡️ Tips
✅ const baseUrl = 'https://yourdomain.com'; //  Replace with your domain
🔑 Change the password in the script to your own.
🕵️‍♂️ This is casual protection—anyone viewing the page source can still find the password.
🧱 Want real protection? Consider .htaccess or server-level auth later.
